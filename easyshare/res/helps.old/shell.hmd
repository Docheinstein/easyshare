**COMMAND**
    shell - start a local shell

**SYNOPSIS**
    **shell** [*COMMAND*]

**DESCRIPTION**
    If no *COMMAND* is given, start a local shell using the user's preferred shell.
    
    Differently from **exec**, this really opens a pseudo terminal (ssh style).

    If *COMMAND* is given, it is executed on the pseudo terminal (but you won't \
    get a shell unless *COMMAND* is a command invoking a shell)

    Currently supported only if the server is Unix.

    Type "**help** **rshell**" for the remote analogous.
