**COMMAND**
    rm - remove files and directories locally

**SYNOPSIS**
    **rm** [*FILE*]...

**DESCRIPTION**
    Remove local *FILE*s.

    If a *FILE* is a directory, it will be removed recursively.

    If a *FILE* does not exists, it will be ignored.

    This commands never prompts: essentially acts like unix's rm -rf.
