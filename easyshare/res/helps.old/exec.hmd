**COMMAND**
    exec - execute an arbitrary command locally

**SYNOPSIS**
    **exec** *COMMAND*
    **:**    *COMMAND*
    **:***COMMAND*

**DESCRIPTION**
    Executes an arbitrary *COMMAND* locally.

    The *COMMAND* is executed via the shell and therefore allows all the shell \
    features (e.g. variables, glob expansions, redirection).

    This might be useful for execute commands without exiting the easyshare's shell.

    The command can be run either with "**exec** *COMMAND*",  "**:** *COMMAND*" or "**:***COMMAND*".

    Currently supported only for Unix.

**EXAMPLES**
    Usage example:

    **/tmp>** ls
    f1      f2
    **/tmp> exec** _touch f3_
    f1      f2      f3
    **/tmp> :** *echo "hello" > f3*
    **/tmp> :***cat f3*
    hello
