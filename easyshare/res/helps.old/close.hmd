**COMMAND**
    close - close the remote sharing

**SYNOPSIS**
    **close**

**DESCRIPTION**
    Close the currently opened sharing.

    If the sharing connection has been created directly with **open** instead of \
    **connect** and then **open**, than the server connection is closed too (for symmetry).

**EXAMPLES**
    Usage example:

    1. Close sharing connection only
    **/tmp>** connect alice-arch
    **alice-arch - /tmp>** open shared
    **alice-arch.shared:/ - /tmp> close**
    **alice-arch - /tmp> close**

    2. Close both sharing and server connection
    **/tmp>** open music
    **bob-debian.music:/ - /tmp> close**
    **/tmp>**
