**COMMAND**
    cp - copy files and directories locally

**SYNOPSIS**
    **cp** *SOURCE* *DEST*
    **cp** *SOURCE*... *DIR*

**DESCRIPTION**
    Copy local *SOURCE* file or directory to *DEST*, or copy multiple SOURCEs to the directory *DIR*.

    If used with two arguments as "**cp** *SOURCE* *DEST*" the following rules are applied:

    - If *DEST* doesn't exists, *SOURCE* will copied as *DEST*
    - If *DEST* exists and it is a directory, *SOURCE* will be copied into *DEST*
    - If *DEST* exists and it is a file, *SOURCE* must be a file and it will overwrite *DEST*

    If used with at least arguments as "**cp** *SOURCE*... *DIR*" then *DIR* \
    must be an existing directory and *SOURCE*s will be copied into it.
