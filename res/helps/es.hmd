**COMMAND**
    es - client of the easyshare application

**SYNOPSIS**
    es [*OPTION*]... [*COMMAND* [*COMMAND_OPTIONS*]]

**DESCRIPTION**
    **easyshare** is a client-server command line application written in Python for transfer files between network hosts.
    
    **es** is the client of the easyshare network application.
    
    If no *COMMAND* is given, the interactive console is started. If *COMMAND* is a valid command, it is executed and the process quits unless the command is open.
    
    Multiple commands can be given in a single line, either from the shell or from command line, separating those with ";".
    
    **es** reads ~/.esrc file from the home directory at startup, in which some configuration, such as the startup parameter and aliases, can be specified.
    
    Configuration file example (.esrc):
        # set discover_port=12019
        # set verbose=2
        alias l=ls -la
        alias rl=rls -la
        alias s=scan
        alias :=exec
        alias ::=rexec
        alias touch=: touch
        alias cat=: cat
        alias echo=: echo
