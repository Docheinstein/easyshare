IMPOSSIBLEs

- test on windows - create an exe
- Add more unit tests
- Handle addresses instead of numeric IPs
- Info/debug messages re-partition
- GUI?

TODOs

- don't throw commexecerror on xls() xtree() xfind()
- errors refactor
- fix get for FILEs which adds \.
- why after transfer some files to SD, put -S tries to overwrite all (mtime problem)?
- allow -d <dest> for get and put
- the approach of return an outcome does not make sense with multiple command
    probably its just better to print directly in the command

TO_DEBUGs
- fix 1000MB might happen => 1 characters of space to keep into account


DONEs
- transfer reverses order (GET 10 11 12..)
- alias supporting multiple commands?
- separating commands by \n or ;
- command `set` for set variables
- ctr+c while transferring - check for put
- get -sp * -> creates folder 'samples' by itself
- s now is -NS not only -N - check for put
- -S does not work
- .esrc as execute every line
- don't show "." in put -p
