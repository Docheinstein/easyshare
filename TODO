- test on windows - create an exe
- Add more unit tests
- Handle addresses instead of numeric IPs
- Info/debug messages re-partition
- ctr+c while transferring
- tree error not exists
- don't throw commexecerror on xls() xtree() xfind()
- errors refactor
- don't show "." in put -p
- hard: quoting with ctypes + libreadline
- s now is -NS not only -N
- fix get for FILEs which adds \.
- rsh is broken... (only zsh?)
- fix 1000MB might happen => 1 characters of space to keep into account
- -S does not work
- fix rsh /bin/bhsa -> wrong command
- why after transfer some files to SD, put -S tries to overwrite all (mtime problem)?
- strange rengeder effect: the | remains printed for 'scan'
- rexec disabled just returns "Error"
- add aliases to autocomplete
- resolve symbol link (e.g. android)
