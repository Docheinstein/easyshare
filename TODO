- test on windows - create an exe
- Add more unit tests
- Handle addresses instead of numeric IPs
- Info/debug messages re-partition
- ctr+c while transferring
- tree error not exists
- don't throw commexecerror on xls() xtree() xfind()
- errors refactor
- don't show "." in put -p
- hard: quoting with ctypes + libreadline
- s now is -NS not only -N
- fix get for FILEs which adds \.
- rsh is broken... (only zsh?)
- fix 1000MB might happen => 1 characters of space to keep into account
- -S does not work
- why after transfer some files to SD, put -S tries to overwrite all (mtime problem)?
- Consider whether removing exec/rexec in place of sh, rsh

TEST: ensure that posix=False is not bad
sh vim \t
shell passthrough
=======

- fix rsh /bin/bhsa -> wrong command
