- test on windows - create an exe
- Add more unit tests
- Handle addresses instead of numeric IPs
- Info/debug messages re-partition
- ctr+c while transferring
    // {action: abort}
- don't throw commexecerror on xls() xtree() xfind()
- errors refactor
- don't show "." in put -p
- s now is -NS not only -N
- fix get for FILEs which adds \.
- fix 1000MB might happen => 1 characters of space to keep into account
- -S does not work
- why after transfer some files to SD, put -S tries to overwrite all (mtime problem)?
- GUI?
- transfer referses order (GET 10 11 12..)
- allow -d <dest> for get and put
